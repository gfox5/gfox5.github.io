    <h2>About me:</h2>   
    <p>Pronouns: she/her</p>
    <p>I'm originaly from Georgia, and moved to Colorado after high school to experience mountain life.
        I'm currently majoring in Creative Technology and Design. My hobbies include: hiking, travelling, snowboarding, reading, writing, raving, and making art. I have
         a dog named Draco and we love going on adventures together.  </p>
    <p>My goals for this course are to master the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. 
        Not only do I want to learn the syntax but understand how these languages
        work together to create interesting and dynamic webpages. I also want to 
        continue developing my eye for design. One stretch goal that I hope to reach
        by the end of the semester is building an e-commerce website for my boyfriend's clothing 
        business.
