    <p>Pronouns: she/her</p>
    <p>I'm originaly from Georgia but have lived in Colorado for almost 4 years now. Im a Creative 
        Technology and Design major and am going into my junior year. Outside of school,
    I like to make art, go to concerts, and be outside.  </p>
    <p>My goals for this course are to build on my web development skills and get better
        at HTML and CSS. I took this class last semester and didn't do as well as I wanted
        to, so I'm excited to solidify my knowledge.
