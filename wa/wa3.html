      It involves descending a snowy surface with the rider's feet attached to a
      snowboard. It's popularity in the United States peaked in 2007. While it's
      popularity has declined slightly, it is still enjoyed by many, and will be

        Snowboards were first developed in 1965 when an engineer in Muskegon,
        Michigan named Sherm Poppen created a toy for his kids. This device was
        two skis fastened together with a rope attached to one end. Him and his
        wife, Nancy, called the invention the "snurfer" and sold the licensing
        to a manufacturer. In 1966 alone, over half a million snurfers were
        sold.

        Modern snowboards were invented by

          >Tom Sims</a

        and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Burton_Carpenter"
          >Jake Burton Carpenter</a
        >. Sims created his first snowboard by gluing carpet to the top of a
        piece of wood, and aluminum to the bottom. He started producing
        snowboards commercially in the 1970s. Burton was an avid snurfer. At the
        age of 14, he competed at the Michigan snurfing competition and
        impressed the crowd with his own self-designed

        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the sport gained traction in the 1970s and 1980s, pioneers came up
        with new designs for boards and bindings. As the technology developed,
        snowboarders could achieve greater feats and do more advanced tricks.
        The first USA National Snowboard race was held near Woodstock, Vermont
        at Suicide Six.

      <p>
        Similar to other extreme sports, there are risks associated with
        snowboarding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Snowboarders face a greature risk of fracture than skiiers, especially
        in the upper extremeties. However, the risk of injury to the lower
        extremities is much lower. In comparison to skiiers, the risk of injury
        to snowboarders is around five per thousand people per day, which is
        double the injury rate for skiiers. Beginners are more likely to
        experience injury, especially if they do not take lessons with an
        experienced instructor. In fact, one quarter of all injuries are
        accquired by first-timers, and one half of all injuries happen to those
        with less than one year's experience. While beginners are more prone to
        injury, experienced riders tend to get more severe injuries.
      </p>
      <h3>Common Injuries</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Head Injury</dt>
        <dd>
          Two to six times greater risk for snowboarders than skiiers. Most
          likely to occur when carrying out a heelside turn. Failure in doing so
          results in landing on the backside and slamming the head into the
          ground.
        </dd>
        <dt>Wrist Injury</dt>
        <dd>
          Forty percent of all snowboarding related injuries are to the wrists,
          with 100,000 wrist fractures each year worldwide.
        </dd>
        <dt>Knee Injury</dt>
        <dd>
          Fifteen percent of snowboarding injuries are knee related,
          specifically to the knee ligaments.
        </dd>
        <dt>Ankle Injury</dt>
        <dd>
          While lower leg and ankle injuries are rare, injury to the talus bone
          accounts for 2% of all snowboarding injuries. It is commonly
          misdiagnosed as a sprain, but some medical professionals refer to this
          injury as "snowboarder's ankle".
        </dd>
        <dt>Injuries in the Lift Line</dt>
        <dd>
          Many injuries take place while waiting for or getting off of the
          chairlift. This is due to the fact that snowboarders will push
          themselves through the line with one foot strapped in, while the other
          is free. This is most likely to result in knee injuries to the leading
          foot.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <h3>Precautions to Take</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Helmet</dt>
        <dd>
          It is strongly recommended to wear a helmet while partaking in winter
          sports. Even if you are a cautious rider, it is important to realize
          that other people on the mountain may not be. Helments significantly
          reduce the risk of head injury.
        </dd>
        <dt>Protective Eyewear</dt>
        <dd>
          Eye Injury can occur from impact and exposure to bright light in snow
          covered areas. Wearing eye protection can protect from
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photokeratitis" target="_blank"
            >snow blindness</a
          >
          and injury to the eyes.
        </dd>
        <dt>Lessons</dt>
        <dd>
          Taking a lesson with an experienced rider can greatly decrease risk of
          injury on your first ride. An instructure will provide expertise and
          technical knowledge, such as the correct way to fall, and how to use
          your <a href="#edges"> edges</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Avalanche Training</dt>
        <dd>
          Avalanches are very common in alpine environments. Avalanche teams at
          ski resorts take precautions so that they are less likely to occur
          within bounds. It is still important to have knowledge on what to do
          in such event and how to prevent one's causation, especially if riding
          in the
          <a

          >.
        </dd>
        <dt>Equipment</dt>
        <dd>
          It is important to fit yourself with the correct equipment for riding.
          Snowboard boots should fit snugly with the toes touching the front of
          the boot when standing up straight. Padding is strongly recommended on
          parts of the body such as hips, knees, shoulders, teeth, and butt.
        </dd>
        <dt>Riding Alone</dt>
        <dd>
          Many experts advise against riding alone especially around dense
          trees. When there is lots of snow on the ground, there is a high risk
          of encountering

      <p>
        Early on in snowboarding history, there was a rebellion against skiing
        culture. Skiiers were hesitant to accept snowboarders on the slopes.
        Snowboarding culture became very similar to skateboarding and surfing
        culture. Early snowboarders incorporated urban and punk styles into
        their look and attitude. Words such as "dude", "gnarly", and "Shred the
        Gnar" emerged from snowboarding culture.
